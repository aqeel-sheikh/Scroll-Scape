# SCROLL SCAPE 🎢

## 🌌 My Journey – A Story Told in Code  

A storytelling web project that visualizes my journey into coding — from struggles to small wins to building a vision for the future.  

This isn’t just a static site — it’s designed like a narrative, with sections that reflect different stages of growth, styled with gradients, animated cards, and smooth transitions.

## 💡 Why This Project?  

This project represents **my coding journey**.  
It’s more than a simple app — it’s a creative experiment that combines **design, storytelling, and frontend skills** in one place.  

I wanted to build something that not only tests my technical abilities but also reflects **who I am as a developer**.

## 🔮 Future Improvements  

Here are a few ideas I might add later:  
- 🌘 **Dark mode toggle** for a smoother night-time reading experience   
- 🖼️ **More sections** as my coding journey continues  
- 🌀 **More advanced GSAP animations** (parallax, scroll-triggered effects)
