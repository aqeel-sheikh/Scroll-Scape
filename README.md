🌌 My Journey – A Story Told in Code

A storytelling web project that visualizes my journey into coding — from struggles to small wins to building a vision for the future.

This isn’t just a static site — it’s designed like a narrative, with sections that reflect different stages of growth, styled with gradients, animated cards, and smooth transitions.

💡 Why This Project?

This project represents my coding journey.
It’s more than a simple app — it’s a creative experiment that combines design, storytelling, and frontend skills in one place.

I wanted to build something that not only tests my technical skills but also reflects who I am as a developer.
